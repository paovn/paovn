## 🚀 About Me
Hi all, I'm Paola Veloza

I am a Telematics engineer with 3 years of experience in monitoring cloud architectures, specializing in projects on AWS and Azure. During my university studies, I learned the Java programming language and acquired knowledge in communication networks, in addition to leading the infrastructure team in a capstone project using agile methodologies such as Scrum.

Passionate about learning and teaching, I seek to strengthen my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and DevOps culture to design cloud architectures that deliver significant results for projects and the company. I hold the AZ-900 certification, which validates my knowledge of cloud technologies. At Globant, I participated in a course on AWS fundamentals and DevOps methodology, where I recognized the importance of documenting processes and optimizing their efficiency. I also have experience with Power BI, Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform, and have worked on documenting monitoring processes and runbooks.
